# sw3-apks

## About:

This is the installation files needed to install SW3 Closed Beta Version 2022.1.2854 for ARM64 Android devices.  
  
  
Because SW3 is a huge game, it is split into 3 main files:  
  
1-com.maxgames.stickwar3.apk - The base game.  
2-config.arm64_v8a.apk - Hardware configuration, required to run the game.  
3-UnityDataAssetPack.apk - All the assets needed.  
  
As such, all 3 files need to be installed at the same time. Luckily, this can be easily done.  
  
## Installation:


Step 1: Download SAI (SplitAPKInstaller) from one of the following sources:  
  
Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aefyr.sai  
Github: https://github.com/Aefyr/SAI  
F-Droid: https://f-droid.org/packages/com.aefyr.sai.fdroid/  
  
  
Step 2: Go to "Settings > Security > Install Unknown Apps > SAI", and enable it to install unknown apps.  
  
Step 3: Move the 3 APK files to your Device.  
  
Step 4: Open SAI and click "Install APKs"  
  
Step 5: Find all the .apks file, select it, then click install.  
  
Step 6: If all works, it should work.  
  
  
## Helping:  
  
You can always help us by providing us the files to the closed beta. You can do this via SAI easily:  
  
Step 1: Download SAI (links above)  
  
Step 2: Click "Backup"  
  
Step 3: Choose "Internal File Picker"  
  
Step 4: Choose anywhere on your phone to extract the files to.  
  
Step 5: Click on SW3 app.  
  
Step 6: There should be a ".apks" file where you told SAI to backup to. That file is all what we need. You can send it via GDrive or any preferred method.  
  
  
Thanks.
